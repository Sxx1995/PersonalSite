Hi, everyone! Here a human evaluation is required for my current video captioning project. I would be grateful if you can spend some time on it to finish the evaluation. you can launch the system with http://155.69.146.170:5000. In the system, you need to evaluate a few samples, which requires watching a short video clip and evaluating 3 captions generated from the different models based on their relevance and richness. Thank you very much for your help.
